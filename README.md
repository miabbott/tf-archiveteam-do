# Run Archive Team Warrior on Digital Ocean

Terraform configuration to deploy a Fedora CoreOS droplet with an Archive Team Warrior container started by default.

Requires a custom Fedora CoreOS image to be previously uploaded to the region you want to deploy to.

The `systemd` unit is a copy/paste of a unit generated by `podman generate systemd`; probably could be improved.

## Usage

1. Get an API Token from Digital Ocean and stick it in `~/.config/digitalocean/token`
2. Upload Fedora CoreOS image to the region you want to deploy to
3. Edit `main.tf` to use an SSH key that was already uploaded to Digital Ocean
4. Edit `droplet.tf` to use the image ID that you just uploaded and change any other parameters you would like
5. Edit `config.yaml` to include your SSH public key
6. Run `terraform` commands:
   1. `terraform init`
   2. `terraform fmt`
   3. `terraform validate`
   4. `terraform plan -out=warrior.plan`
   5. `terraform apply warrior.plan`
